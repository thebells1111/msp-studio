<p>Back on the MSP builder tab, paste the copy linked into the 'Link to Track mp3 File'</p>
<p>If your mp3 is accessible to the apps, you'll see the Preview Player pop up</p>
<p>
	If it doesn't pop up, there's most likely a CORS issue, and you'll have to contact your hosting
	provider to figure out how to enable CORS.
